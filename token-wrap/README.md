# STACC-powered impl

The stacc-powered impl of this token-wrap program allows the payer to specify which, if any, t22 extensions and the options for them on CreateMint, if wrapping to t22.

You can find the v0.1.0 version, supporting vanilla transfer fees, of this impl lovingly provided here: [token-wrap with optional transfer-fees](https://github.com/kekloldyormarket/solana-program-library/tree/features/token-wrap-impl-stacc-powered)
